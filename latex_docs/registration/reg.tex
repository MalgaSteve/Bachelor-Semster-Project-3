\section{Abstract}
\subsection{Scientific:}
The scientific question answered in this project will be: How to detect if a
password file is in possession of intruders and at the same time prevent
phishing attacks? First of all this paper goes into technologies used to alarm
the system administrator if an attacker has unauthorized access to the password
file. Afterward, it covers how this is combined with PAKE (Password Access
Key Exchange) to prevent phishing attacks. 

\subsection{Technical:}
The technical part will be a system that alarms the system administrator of
potential attackers having the password file. It uses the technical properties
picked up by the scientific part. The project will be written in Python and it
will implement PAKE that ensures further security for the password file to
prevent for example phishing attacks.
